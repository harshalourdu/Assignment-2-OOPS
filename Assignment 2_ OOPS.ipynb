    "\n",
    "Parameterized Constructors\n",
    "Parameterized constructors are useful when you want to create an object with custom values for its attributes. They allow you to specify the values of the object’s attributes when the object is created, rather than using default values.\n",

It includes object details such as data members, internal work. Data hiding excludes full data entry to class members and defends object integrity by preventing unintended changes. Data hiding also minimizes system complexity for increase robustness by limiting interdependencies between software requirements. Data hiding is also known as information hiding. In class, if we declare the data members as private so that no other class can access the data members, then it is a process of hiding data."

    "encapsulation and information hiding are essential principles in object-oriented programming, promoting code modularity, security, and maintainability. Encapsulation bundles data and methods within a class, while information hiding conceals the internal details of the class from external access. Together, these concepts enable developers to create robust and well-organized software systems, ensuring that changes to the internal implementation of classes do not affect other parts of the program. By providing clear interfaces for interaction and protecting sensitive data, encapsulation and information hiding enhance software design, reusability, and security, making them vital aspects of modern software development."

    "\n",
    "Difference between abstract class and interface:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface, on the other hand, is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method implementation: In an abstract class, some methods can be implemented, while others are left abstract, meaning that they have no implementation and must be overridden by concrete subclasses. In contrast, all methods in an interface are by default abstract and must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.\n",

    "Interface: \n",
    "Features of interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defines a set of methods and properties: An interface defines a set of methods and properties that must be implemented by any class or structure that implements the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides a common protocol: Interfaces provide a common protocol that allows different software components to communicate with each other.\n",
    "Supports polymorphism: An interface can be used to achieve polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they belong to the same type, as long as they implement the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables separation of concerns: Interfaces enable separation of concerns, which means that different parts of a software system can be developed independently of each other, as long as they adhere to the interface specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves code reusability: Interfaces improve code reusability by allowing different software components to reuse the same code base, as long as they implement the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforces design patterns: Interfaces can be used to enforce design patterns, such as the Adapter pattern, by requiring that certain methods or properties be implemented by the implementing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facilitates testing: Interfaces facilitate testing by allowing software components to be tested independently of each other, using mock objects that implement the interface."

The changes in global data mean tracing back to all modules which access that data to evaluate the effect of the change. So it has got disadvantages like difficulty in reusing modules, reduced ability to control data accesses, and reduced maintainability.\n",

A class C can be component coupled with another class C1, if C has an instance variable of type C1, or C has a method whose parameter is of type C1,or if C has a method which has a local variable of type C1. It should be clear that whenever there is component coupling, there is likely to be interaction coupling."

    "# 15. Explain how composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module simply means the software components that are been created by dividing the software. The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other. This process of creating software modules is known as Modularity in software engineering. It simply measures the degree to which these components are made up than can be combined. Some of the projects or software designs are very complex that it’s not easy to understand its working and functioning. In such cases, modularity is a key weapon that helps in reducing the complexity of such software or projects. The basic principle of Modularity is that “Systems should be built from cohesive, loosely coupled components (modules)” which means s system should be made up of different components that are united and work together in an efficient way and such components have a well-defined function. To define a modular system, several properties or criteria are there under which we can evaluate a design method while considering its abilities. These criteria are defined by Meyer. Some of them are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Decomposability – Decomposability simply means to break down something into smaller pieces. Modular decomposability means to break down the problem into different sub-problems in a systematic manner. Solving a large problem is difficult sometimes, so the decomposition helps in reducing the complexity of the problem, and sub-problems created can be solved independently. This helps in achieving the basic principle of modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Composability – Composability simply means the ability to combine modules that are created. It’s actually the principle of system design that deals with the way in which two or more components are related or connected to each other. Modular composability means to assemble the modules into a new system that means to connect the combine the components into a new system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Understandability – Understandability simply means the capability of being understood, quality of comprehensible. Modular understandability means to make it easier for the user to understand each module so that it is very easy to develop software and change it as per requirement. Sometimes it’s not easy to understand the process models because of its complexity and its large size in structure. Using modularity understandability, it becomes easier to understand the problem in an efficient way without any issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Continuity – Continuity simply means unbroken or consistent or uninterrupted connection for a long period of time without any change or being stopped. Modular continuity means making changes to the system requirements that will cause changes in the modules individually without causing any effect or change in the overall system or software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Protection – Protection simply means to keep something safe from any harms, to protect against any unpleasant means or damage. Modular protection means to keep safe the other modules from the abnormal condition occurring in a particular module at run time. The abnormal condition can be an error or failure also known as run-time errors. The side effects of these errors are constrained within the module.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, you can add new attributes to your classes and instances dynamically. This possibility allows you to attach new data and behavior to your classes and objects in response to changing requirements or contexts. It also allows you to adapt existing classes to specific and dynamic needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you provide the User class with an initializer or .__init__() method. In this method, you take the name and job arguments, which you turn into instance attributes in the method’s body. Then you add the method to User dynamically. After this addition, you can create User objects by passing the name and job to the class constructor.\n",

    "A word of caution is in order, as many of Python’s built-in mechanisms implicitly assume that objects have the .__dict__ attribute. When you use .__slots__(), then you waive that assumption, which means that some of those mechanisms might not work as expected anymore.\n",
